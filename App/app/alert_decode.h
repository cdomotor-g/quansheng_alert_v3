/* ALERT (ERTS) telemetry frame decoder.
 *
 * Portable C, no dependencies, host-testable (tools/test_alert_decode.c).
 * Bit layouts follow the MegaNet codec (packets.js FORMATS table) and the BoM
 * "ERTS Data Formats" spec: four asynchronous 10-bit words (start + 8 data
 * bits LSB-first + stop), 300 baud, negative logic in Australian field
 * hardware (start = 1, stop = 0), carrying a 13-bit address and 11-bit value.
 *
 * Supported wire formats:
 *   ABF  ALERT Binary Format         check bits 10 / 10 / 11 / 11, no CRC
 *   EIF  Enhanced IFLOWS Format      check bits 11, 6-bit FCS x^6+x^4+x^3+1
 *   A2C  ALERT2 concentration record 4 packed bytes (no framing) - for
 *        payloads already delivered as bytes, e.g. an ALERT2 IND 0x74 element
